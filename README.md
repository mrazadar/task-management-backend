# TODO: Learn the following and apply into this project.

- Winston (is the most popular logging library for Node.js. It aims to make logging more flexible and extensible by decoupling different aspects such as log levels, formatting, and storage so that each API is independent and many combinations are supported. It also uses Node.js streams to minimize the performance impact of implementing logging in your application.)

- Morgan (Morgan is a popular HTTP request logger middleware for Node.js, particularly used with the Express.js framework. It simplifies the process of logging details about incoming HTTP requests and their corresponding responses in a Node.js application.)

- http-status-codes (HTTP status codes are standardized numerical codes returned by a server in response to a client's request to indicate the outcome of that request. In Node.js, these codes are crucial for building robust web applications and APIs, as they communicate the status of an operation to the client.
  Node.js's built-in http module provides access to these status codes through the http.STATUS_CODES object. This object maps the numerical status code to its corresponding human-readable phrase.)

- AdminJS (The leading Open-Source Admin Panel for your Node.js Application)

- "@sentry/integrations": "^7.54.0" (for sentry integrations)
- "@sentry/node": "^7.54.0" (for integrating sentry into nodejs)
- "@sentry/tracing": "^7.54.0" (for enabling sentry tracing)

- Playwright (Playwright is a Node.js library to automate Chromium, Firefox and WebKit with a single API. It enables cross-browser web automation that is ever-green, capable, reliable and fast. It automatically downloads browser binaries or uses the bundled Chromium binaries. It also supports all modern web standards, like CSS selectors and the Fetch API.)
